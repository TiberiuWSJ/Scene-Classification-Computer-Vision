# Scene Classification - Image Processing

In this project, we tackle the challenge of classifying images of natural scenes into six distinct categories using a diverse dataset. The dataset comprises approximately 25,000 images capturing a wide range of natural scenes from various locations around the globe. The primary objective is to develop a robust image processing model capable of accurately categorizing each image into one of the following six classes:

1.**Buildings**  

2.**Forests**  

3.**Mountains**  

4.**Glacier**  

5.**Street**  

6.**Sea**
